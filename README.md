These are just some of my solutions to problems of varying difficulty on
CodeEval. Some of them are very old and thus probably bad examples of
a good solution, while others I believe are rather pythonic solutions to 
the given problem. This repository is mostly just for personal management
of the solutions, however feel free to commit changes or use any solutions
as a helpful guide. Please don't just copy and paste, you'll just be wasting
your own time lol
